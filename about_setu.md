# Platform Engineering

**Platform engineering** is a practice built up from DevOps principles that seeks to improve each development team’s security, compliance, costs, and time-to-business value through enhanced developer experiences and self-service within a secure, governed framework. It represents both a product-based mindset shift and a set of tools and systems to support that shift.

## Industry Trends

Lately, there has been a lot of industry excitement around the term platform engineering. Gartner expects that around **80% of engineering organizations** will have a dedicated platform engineering team by 2026. These teams focus on building what is known as an **internal developer platform**. Regardless of domain – whether it's sales (Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce), service fulfillment (ServiceNow), or communications (Twilio) – platforms are inherently designed to achieve scale and reduce the time it takes to deliver business value.

## Developer Platforms

Platforms that developers either use or extend have the power to eliminate toil throughout the development process by providing highly optimized developer experiences and simplified operations. These platforms include tools that:

- **Empower Developer Self-Sufficiency:**  
  Tools such as starter kits and IDE plugins help developers work more independently.
- **Assist with Common Tasks:**  
  They offer built-in solutions for routine tasks.
- **Encapsulate Reusable Patterns:**  
  Common patterns and practices are packaged into reusable building blocks.
- **Provide Early Advice and Feedback:**  
  Platforms can offer immediate guidance on issues or potential security risks.
- **Simplify Operations:**  
  They manage underlying infrastructure and tools, reducing operational complexity.
